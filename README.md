# Lingotek Coding Challenge
This application does two things:
  1. pulls down content about the authenticated user from pinterest using the pinterest api
  2. lists languages from a remote JSON containing country objects

currently, the app is set up to be hosted on heroku [here](https://lingotek-test.herokuapp.com/index.html), but can be adapted to other places by creating your own pinterest app and editing the source code to use the app you create.
